 * Lintcode 800. Backpack IX
 * You have a total of n thousand yuan, hoping to apply for a university abroad. The application is 
 * required to pay a certain fee. Give the cost of each university application and the probability 
 * of getting the University's offer, and the number of university is m. If the economy allows, you 
 * can apply for multiple universities. Find the highest probability of receiving at least one offer.
 * Example
 * Example 1:
 * 	Input:  
 * 		n = 10
 * 		prices = [4,4,5]
 * 		probability = [0.1,0.2,0.3]
 * 	Output:  0.440	
 * 	Explanationï¼š
 * 	select the second and the third school. 
 * Example 2:
 * 	Input: 
 * 		n = 10
 * 		prices = [4,5,6]
 * 		probability = [0.1,0.2,0.3]
 * 	Output:  0.370
 * 	Explanation:
 * 	select the first and the third school.	
 * Notice
 * 0<=n<=10000,0<=m<=10000
